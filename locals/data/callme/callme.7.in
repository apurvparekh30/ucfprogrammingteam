1000 my fellow citizens i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition fortyfour americans have now taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents so it has been so it must be with this generation of americans that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood our nation is at war against a farreaching network of violence and hatred our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land a nagging fear that americas decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights today i say to you that the challenges we face are real they are serious and they are many they will not be met easily or in a short span of time but know this america they will be met on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the godgiven promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given it must be earned our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less it has not been the path for the fainthearted for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame rather it has been the risktakers the doers the makers of things some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction this is the journey we continue today we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year our capacity remains undiminished but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions that time has surely passed starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america for everywhere we look there is work to be done the state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technologys wonders to raise health cares quality and lower its cost we will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age all this we can do and all this we will do now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans their memories are short for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified where the answer is yes we intend to move forward where the answer is no programs will end
1000 and those of us who manage the publics dollars will be held to account to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals our founding fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expediences sake and so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and we are ready to lead once more recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint we are the keepers of this legacy guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort even greater cooperation and understanding between nations we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hardearned peace in afghanistan with old friends and former foes well work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and nonbelievers we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their societys ills on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the worlds resources without regard to effect for the world has changed and we must change with it as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol faroff deserts and distant mountains they have something to tell us just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages we honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves and yet at this moment a moment that will define a generation it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours it is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate our challenges may be new the instruments with which we meet them may be new but those values upon which our success depends honesty and hard work courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism these things are old these things are true they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history what is demanded then is a
1000 return to these truths what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task this is the price and the promise of citizenship this is the source of our confidence the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled in the year of americas birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river the capital was abandoned the enemy was advancing the snow was stained with blood at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it america in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come let it be said by our childrens children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and gods grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america on behalf of the great state of illinois crossroads of a nation land of lincoln let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention tonight is a particular honor for me because lets face it my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely my father was a foreign student born and raised in a small village in kenya he grew up herding goats went to school in a tinroof shack his father my grandfather was a cook a domestic servant but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place america which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before while studying here my father met my mother she was born in a town on the other side of the world in kansas her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the depression the day after pearl harbor he signed up for duty joined pattons army and marched across europe back home my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line after the war they studied on the gi bill bought a house through fha and moved west in search of opportunity and they too had big dreams for their daughter a common dream born of two continents my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they would give me an african name barack or blessed believing that in a tolerant america your name is no barrier to success they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they werent rich because in a generous america you dont have to be rich to achieve your potential they are both passed away now yet i know that on this night they look down on me with pride i stand here today grateful for the diversity of my heritage aware that my parents dreams live on in my precious daughters i stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger american story that i owe a debt to all of those who came before me and that in no other country on earth is my story even possible tonight we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation not because of the height of our skyscrapers or the power of our military or the size of our economy our pride is based on a very simple premise summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago we hold these truths to he selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that is the true genius of america a faith in the simple dreams of its people the insistence on small miracles that we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm that we can say what we think write what we think without hearing a sudden knock on the door that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebodys son that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution and that our votes will he counted or at least most of the time this year in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up to the legacy of our
1000 forbearers and the promise of future generations and fellow americans democrats republicans independents i say to you tonight we have more work to do more to do for the workers i met in galesburg illinois who are losing their union jobs at the maytag plant thats moving to mexico and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour more to do for the father i met who was losing his job and choking back tears wondering how he would pay a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits he counted on more to do for the young woman in east st louis and thousands more like her who has the grades has the drive has the will but doesnt have the money to go to college dont get me wrong the people i meet in small towns and big cities in diners and office parks they dont expect government to solve all their problems they know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to go into the collar counties around chicago and people will tell you they dont want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the pentagon go into any inner city neighborhood and folks will tell you that government alone cant teach kids to learn they know that parents have to parent that children cant achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white no people dont expect government to solve all their problems but they sense deep in their bones that with just a change in priorities we can make sure that every child in america has a decent shot at life and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all they know we can do better and they want that choice in this election we offer that choice our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer that man is john kerry john kerry understands the ideals of community faith and sacrifice because theyve defined his life from his heroic service in vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor through two decades in the united states senate he has devoted himself to this country again and again weve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available his values and his record affirm what is best in us john kerry believes in an america where hard work is rewarded so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas hell offer them to companies creating jobs here at home john kerry believes in an america where all americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in washington have for themselves john kerry believes in energy independence so we arent held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields john kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us and john kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option but it should never he the first option a while back i met a young man named shamus at the vfw hall in east moline illinois he was a goodlooking kid sixtwo or sixthree cleareyed with an easy smile he told me hed joined the marines and was heading to iraq the following week as i listened to him explain why hed enlisted his absolute faith in our country and its leaders his devotion to duty and service i thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child but then i asked myself are we serving shamus as well as he was serving us i thought of more than service men and women sons and daughters husbands and wives friends and neighbors who will not be returning to their hometowns i thought of families i had met who were struggling to get by without a loved ones full income or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered but who still lacked longterm health benefits because they were reservists when we send our young men and women into harms way we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going to care for their families while theyre gone to tend to the soldiers upon their return and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war secure the peace and earn the respect of the world now let me be clear we have real enemies in the world these enemies must be found they must be pursued and they must be defeated john kerry knows this and just as lieutenant kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in vietnam president kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep america safe and secure john kerry believes in america and he knows its not enough for just some of us to prosper for alongside our famous individualism theres another ingredient in the american saga a belief that we are connected as one people if theres a child on the south side of chicago who cant read that matters to me even if its not my child if theres a senior citizen somewhere who cant pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent that makes my life poorer even if its not my grandmother if theres an arab american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties its that fundamental belief i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper that makes this
1000 country work its what allows us to pursue our individual dreams yet still come together as a single american family e pluribus unum out of many one yet even as we speak there are those who are preparing to divide us the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes well i say to them tonight theres not a liberal america and a conservative america theres the united states of america theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america the pundits like to sliceanddice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and patriots who supported it we are one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes all of us defending the united states of america in the end thats what this election is about do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope john kerry calls on us to hope john edwards calls on us to hope im not talking about blind optimism here the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just dont talk about it or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it no im talking about something more substantial its the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the mekong delta the hope of a millworkers son who dares to defy the odds the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too the audacity of hope in the end that is gods greatest gift to us the bedrock of this nation the belief in things not seen the belief that there are better days ahead i believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity i believe we can provide jobs to the jobless homes to the homeless and reclaim young people in cities across america from violence and despair i believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us america tonight if you feel the same energy i do the same urgency i do the same passion i do the same hopefulness i do if we do what we must do then i have no doubt that all across the country from florida to oregon from washington to maine the people will rise up in november and john kerry will be sworn in as president and john edwards will be sworn in as vice president and this country will reclaim its promise and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come thank you and god bless you we the people in order to form a more perfect union two hundred and twenty one years ago in a hall that still stands across the street a group of men gathered and with these simple words launched americas improbable experiment in democracy farmers and scholars statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of the document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished it was stained by this nations original sin of slavery a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years and to leave any final resolution to future generations of course the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution a constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law a constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union that could be and should be perfected over time and yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the united states what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time this was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this campaign to continue the long march of those who came before us a march for a more just more equal more free more caring and more prosperous america i chose to run for the presidency at this moment in history because i believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories but we hold common hopes that we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place but we all want to move in the same direction towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren this belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the american people but it also comes from my own american story i am the son of a black man from kenya and a white woman from kansas i was raised with the help of a
1000 white grandfather who survived a depression to serve in pattons army during world war ii and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at fort leavenworth while he was overseas ive gone to some of the best schools in america and lived in one of the worlds poorest nations i am married to a black american who carries within her the blood of slaves and slaveowners an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters i have brothers sisters nieces nephews uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents and for as long as i live i will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible its a story that hasnt made me the most conventional candidate but it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts that out of many we are truly one throughout the first year of this campaign against all predictions to the contrary we saw how hungry the american people were for this message of unity despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country in south carolina where the confederate flag still flies we built a powerful coalition of african americans and white americans this is not to say that race has not been an issue in the campaign at various stages in the campaign some commentators have deemed me either too black or not black enough we saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the south carolina primary the press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization not just in terms of white and black but black and brown as well and yet it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn on one end of the spectrum weve heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action that its based solely on the desire of wideeyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap on the other end weve heard my former pastor reverend jeremiah wright use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation that rightly offend white and black alike i have already condemned in unequivocal terms the statements of reverend wright that have caused such controversy for some nagging questions remain did i know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of american domestic and foreign policy of course did i ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while i sat in church yes did i strongly disagree with many of his political views absolutely just as im sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed but the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm werent simply controversial they werent simply a religious leaders effort to speak out against perceived injustice instead they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam as such reverend wrights comments were not only wrong but divisive divisive at a time when we need unity racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems two wars a terrorist threat a falling economy a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change problems that are neither black or white or latino or asian but rather problems that confront us all given my background my politics and my professed values and ideals there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough why associate myself with reverend wright in the first place they may ask why not join another church and i confess that if all that i knew of reverend wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and you tube or if trinity united church of christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators there is no doubt that i would react in much the same way but the truth is that isnt all that i know of the man the man i met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my christian faith a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another to care for the sick and lift up the poor he is a man who served his country as a us marine who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country and who for over thirty years led a church that serves the community by doing gods work here on earth by housing the homeless ministering to the needy providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries and reaching out to those suffering from hivaids in my first book dreams from my father i described the experience of my first service at trinity people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the raftersand in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and
1000 pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame aboutmemories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild that has been my experience at trinity like other predominantly black churches across the country trinity embodies the black community in its entirety the doctor and the welfare mom the model student and the former gangbanger like other black churches trinitys services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor they are full of dancing clapping screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear the church contains in full the kindness and cruelty the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance the struggles and successes the love and yes the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in america and this helps explain perhaps my relationship with reverend wright as imperfect as he may be he has been like family to me he strengthened my faith officiated my wedding and baptized my children not once in my conversations with him have i heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect he contains within him the contradictions the good and the bad of the community that he has served diligently for so many years i can no more disown him than i can disown the black community i can no more disown him than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe these people are a part of me and they are a part of america this country that i love some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable i can assure you it is not i suppose the politically safe thing would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork we can dismiss reverend wright as a crank or a demagogue just as some have dismissed geraldine ferraro in the aftermath of her recent statements as harboring some deepseated racial bias but race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now we would be making the same mistake that reverend wright made in his offending sermons about america to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality the fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that weve never really worked through a part of our union that we have yet to perfect and if we walk away now if we simply retreat into our respective corners we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every american understanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point as william faulkner once wrote the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past we do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country but we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist in the africanamerican community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow segregated schools were and are inferior schools we still havent fixed them fifty years after brown v board of education and the inferior education they provided then and now helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between todays black and white students legalized discrimination where blacks were prevented often through violence from owning property or loans were not granted to africanamerican business owners or black homeowners could not access fha mortgages or blacks were excluded from unions or the police force or fire departments meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations that history helps explain the wealth and income gap between black and white and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persists in so many of todays urban and rural communities a lack of economic opportunity among black men and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for ones family contributed to the erosion of black families a problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened and the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods parks for kids to play in police walking the beat regular garbage pickup and building code enforcement all helped create a cycle of violence blight and neglect that continue to haunt us this is the reality in which reverend wright and other africanamericans of his generation grew up they came of age in the late fifties and early sixties a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted whats remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination but rather how many men and women overcame the odds how many were able
1000 to make a way out of no way for those like me who would come after them but for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the american dream there were many who didnt make it those who were ultimately defeated in one way or another by discrimination that legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons without hope or prospects for the future even for those blacks who did make it questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways for the men and women of reverend wrights generation the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years that anger may not get expressed in public in front of white coworkers or white friends but it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table at times that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politicians own failings and occasionally it finds voice in the church on sunday morning in the pulpit and in the pews the fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of reverend wrights sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in american life occurs on sunday morning that anger is not always productive indeed all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition and prevents the africanamerican community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change but the anger is real it is powerful and to simply wish it away to condemn it without understanding its roots only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races in fact a similar anger exists within segments of the white community most working and middleclass white americans dont feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race their experience is the immigrant experience as far as theyre concerned no ones handed them anything theyve built it from scratch theyve worked hard all their lives many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pension dumped after a lifetime of labor they are anxious about their futures and feel their dreams slipping away in an era of stagnant wages and global competition opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game in which your dreams come at my expense so when they are told to bus their children to a school across town when they hear that an african american is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed when theyre told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced resentment builds over time like the anger within the black community these resentments arent always expressed in polite company but they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the reagan coalition politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism just as black anger often proved counterproductive so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze a corporate culture rife with inside dealing questionable accounting practices and shortterm greed a washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests economic policies that favor the few over the many and yet to wish away the resentments of white americans to label them as misguided or even racist without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding this is where we are right now its a racial stalemate weve been stuck in for years contrary to the claims of some of my critics black and white i have never been so nave as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own but i have asserted a firm conviction a conviction rooted in my faith in god and my faith in the american people that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union for the africanamerican community that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past it means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of american life but it also means binding our particular grievances for better health care and better schools and better jobs to the larger aspirations of all americans the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling the white man whose been laid off the immigrant trying to feed his family and it means taking full responsibility for own lives by demanding more from our fathers and spending more time with our children and reading to them and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives they must never succumb to despair or cynicism they must always believe that they can write their own destiny ironically this quintessentially american and yes conservative notion of selfhelp found frequent expression in reverend wrights sermons but what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of selfhelp also requires a belief that society can change the profound mistake of reverend wrights sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our
1000 society its that he spoke as if our society was static as if no progress has been made as if this country a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black latino and asian rich and poor young and old is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past but what we know what we have seen is that america can change that is true genius of this nation what we have already achieved gives us hope the audacity to hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow in the white community the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the africanamerican community does not just exist in the minds of black people that the legacy of discrimination and current incidents of discrimination while less overt than in the past are real and must be addressed not just with words but with deeds by investing in our schools and our communities by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations it requires all americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams that investing in the health welfare and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of america prosper in the end then what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the worlds great religions demand that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us let us be our brothers keeper scripture tells us let us be our sisters keeper let us find that common stake we all have in one another and let our politics reflect that spirit as well for we have a choice in this country we can accept a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism we can tackle race only as spectacle as we did in the oj trial or in the wake of tragedy as we did in the aftermath of katrina or as fodder for the nightly news we can play reverend wrights sermons on every channel every day and talk about them from now until the election and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the american people think that i somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words we can pounce on some gaffe by a hillary supporter as evidence that shes playing the race card or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to john mccain in the general election regardless of his policies we can do that but if we do i can tell you that in the next election well be talking about some other distraction and then another one and then another one and nothing will change that is one option or at this moment in this election we can come together and say not this time this time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and asian children and hispanic children and native american children this time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids cant learn that those kids who dont look like us are somebody elses problem the children of america are not those kids they are our kids and we will not let them fall behind in a st century economy not this time this time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and hispanics who do not have health care who dont have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in washington but who can take them on if we do it together this time we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race and the homes for sale that once belonged to americans from every religion every region every walk of life this time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesnt look like you might take your job its that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit this time we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together and fight together and bleed together under the same proud flag we want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that never shouldve been authorized and never shouldve been waged and we want to talk about how well show our patriotism by caring for them and their families and giving them the benefits they have earned i would not be running for president if i didnt believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of americans want for this country this union may never be perfect but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected and today whenever i find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility what gives me the most hope is the next generation the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election there is one story in particularly that id like to leave you with today a story i told when i had the great honor of speaking on dr kings birthday at his home church ebenezer baptist in atlanta there is a young twentythree year old white woman named ashley baia who organized for our campaign in florence south carolina she had been working to organize a mostly africanamerican community since the beginning of this campaign and one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they
1000 were there and ashley said that when she was nine years old her mother got cancer and because she had to miss days of work she was let go and lost her health care they had to file for bankruptcy and thats when ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom she knew that food was one of their most expensive costs and so ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches because that was the cheapest way to eat she did this for a year until her mom got better and she told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents too now ashley might have made a different choice perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mothers problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work or hispanics who were coming into the country illegally but she didnt she sought out allies in her fight against injustice anyway ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why theyre supporting the campaign they all have different stories and reasons many bring up a specific issue and finally they come to this elderly black man whos been sitting there quietly the entire time and ashley asks him why hes there and he does not bring up a specific issue he does not say health care or the economy he does not say education or the war he does not say that he was there because of barack obama he simply says to everyone in the room i am here because of ashley im here because of ashley by itself that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough it is not enough to give health care to the sick or jobs to the jobless or education to our children but it is where we start it is where our union grows stronger and as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the twohundred and twenty one years since a band of patriots signed that document in philadelphia that is where the perfection begins let me begin by saying thanks to all you whove traveled from far and wide to brave the cold today we all made this journey for a reason its humbling but in my heart i know you didnt come here just for me you came here because you believe in what this country can be in the face of war you believe there can be peace in the face of despair you believe there can be hope in the face of a politics thats shut you out thats told you to settle thats divided us for too long you believe we can be one people reaching for whats possible building that more perfect union thats the journey were on today but let me tell you how i came to be here as most of you know i am not a native of this great state i moved to illinois over two decades ago i was a young man then just a year out of college i knew no one in chicago was without money or family connections but a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for a year and i accepted the job sight unseen motivated then by a single simple powerful idea that i might play a small part in building a better america my work took me to some of chicagos poorest neighborhoods i joined with pastors and laypeople to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings i saw that the problems people faced werent simply local in nature that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away and that when a child turns to violence theres a hole in his heart no government could ever fill it was in these neighborhoods that i received the best education i ever had and where i learned the true meaning of my christian faith after three years of this work i went to law school because i wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need i became a civil rights lawyer and taught constitutional law and after a time i came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate it was with these ideas in mind that i arrived in this capital city as a state senator it was here in springfield where i saw all that is america converge farmers and teachers businessmen and laborers all of them with a story to tell all of them seeking a seat at the table all of them clamoring to be heard i made lasting friendships here friends that i see in the audience today it was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable that its possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as were willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst thats why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken thats why we were able to give health insurance to children in need thats why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families and thats why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never ever be passed it was here in springfield where north south east and west come together that i was
1000 reminded of the essential decency of the american people where i came to believe that through this decency we can build a more hopeful america and that is why in the shadow of the old state capitol where lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together where common hopes and common dreams still i stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the united states i recognize there is a certain presumptuousness a certain audacity to this announcement i know i havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington but ive been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change the genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed and we should take heart because weve changed this country before in the face of tyranny a band of patriots brought an empire to its knees in the face of secession we unified a nation and set the captives free in the face of depression we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty we welcomed immigrants to our shores we opened railroads to the west we landed a man on the moon and we heard a kings call to let justice roll down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream each and every time a new generation has risen up and done whats needed to be done today we are called once more and it is time for our generation to answer that call for that is our unyielding faith that in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it thats what abraham lincoln understood he had his doubts he had his defeats he had his setbacks but through his will and his words he moved a nation and helped free a people it is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided north and south slave and free it is because men and women of every race from every walk of life continued to march for freedom long after lincoln was laid to rest that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together as one people as americans all of us know what those challenges are today a war with no end a dependence on oil that threatens our future schools where too many children arent learning and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can we know the challenges weve heard them weve talked about them for years whats stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans whats stopped us is the failure of leadership the smallness of our politics the ease with which were distracted by the petty and trivial our chronic avoidance of tough decisions our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems for the last six years weve been told that our mounting debts dont matter weve been told that the anxiety americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion weve been told that climate change is a hoax and that tough talk and an illconceived war can replace diplomacy and strategy and foresight and when all else fails when katrina happens or the death toll in iraq mounts weve been told that our crises are somebody elses fault were distracted from our real failures and told to blame the other party or gay people or immigrants and as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration we know whats filled the void the cynics and the lobbyists and the special interests whove turned our government into a game only they can afford to play they write the checks and you get stuck with the bills they get the access while you get to write a letter they think they own this government but were here today to take it back the time for that politics is over its time to turn the page weve made some progress already i was proud to help lead the fight in congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since watergate but washington has a long way to go and it wont be easy thats why well have to set priorities well have to make hard choices and although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go each of us in our own lives will have to accept responsibility for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children for adapting to a more competitive economy for strengthening our communities and sharing some measure of sacrifice so let us begin let us begin this hard work together let us transform this nation let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age lets set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed lets recruit a new army of teachers and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability lets make college more affordable and lets invest in scientific research and lets lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across america and as our economy changes lets be the generation that ensures our nations workers are sharing in our prosperity lets protect the hardearned benefits their companies have promised lets make it possible for hardworking americans to save for retirement and lets allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this countrys middleclass again lets be the generation that ends poverty in america every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job and earn a living wage that can pay the bills and afford child care
1000 so their kids have a safe place to go when they work lets do this lets be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis we can control costs by focusing on prevention by providing better treatment to the chronically ill and using technology to cut the bureaucracy lets be the generation that says right here right now that we will have universal health care in america by the end of the next presidents first term lets be the generation that finally frees america from the tyranny of oil we can harness homegrown alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuelefficient cars we can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases we can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation and job creation and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world lets be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here most of all lets be the generation that never forgets what happened on that september day and confront the terrorists with everything weve got politics doesnt have to divide us on this anymore we can work together to keep our country safe ive worked with republican senator dick lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the worlds deadliest unguarded weapons we can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military we can tighten the net around their finances and we can improve our intelligence capabilities but let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe but all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in iraq most of you know i opposed this war from the start i thought it was a tragic mistake today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones the hearts that have been broken and the young lives that could have been america its time to start bringing our troops home its time to admit that no amount of american lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone elses civil war thats why i have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by march of letting the iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last best hope to pressure the sunni and shia to come to the table and find peace finally there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war and that is the homecoming of the men and women our veterans who have sacrificed the most let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love let us be the generation that begins this work i know there are those who dont believe we can do all these things i understand the skepticism after all every four years candidates from both parties make similar promises and i expect this year will be no different all of us running for president will travel around the country offering tenpoint plans and making grand speeches all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country but too many times after the election is over and the confetti is swept away all those promises fade from memory and the lobbyists and the special interests move in and people turn away disappointed as before left to struggle on their own that is why this campaign cant only be about me it must be about us it must be about what we can do together this campaign must be the occasion the vehicle of your hopes and your dreams it will take your time your energy and your advice to push us forward when were doing right and to let us know when were not this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship restoring our sense of common purpose and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change by ourselves this change will not happen divided we are bound to fail but the life of a tall gangly selfmade springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible he tells us that there is power in words he tells us that there is power in conviction that beneath all the differences of race and region faith and station we are one people he tells us that there is power in hope as lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery he was heard to say of strange discordant and even hostile elements we gathered from the four winds and formed and fought to battle through that is our purpose here today thats why im in this race not just to hold an office but to gather with you to transform a nation i want to win that next battle for justice and opportunity i want to win that next battle for better schools and better jobs and health care for all i want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union and building a better america and if you will join me in this improbable quest if you feel destiny calling and see as i see a future of endless possibility stretching before us if you sense as i sense that the time is now to shake off our slumber and slough off our fear and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations then im ready to take up the cause and march with you and work with you together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this earth i stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances the civil
840 war was one of the bloodiest in history and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword the sacrifice of multitudes that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil i dont oppose all wars my grandfather signed up for a war the day after pearl harbor was bombed fought in pattons army he fought in the name of a larger freedom part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil i dont oppose all wars after september after witnessing the carnage and destruction the dust and the tears i supported this administrations pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance and i would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again i dont oppose all wars what i am opposed to is a dumb war what i am opposed to is a rash war what i am opposed to is the cynical attempt by richard perle and paul wolfowitz and other armchair weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne what i am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like karl rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured a rise in the poverty rate a drop in the median income to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the great depression thats what im opposed to a dumb war a rash war a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics now let me be clear i suffer no illusions about saddam hussein he is a brutal man a ruthless man a man who butchers his own people to secure his own power the world and the iraqi people would be better off without him but i also know that saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the united states or to his neighborsand that in concert with the international community he can be contained until in the way of all petty dictators he falls away into the dustbin of history i know that even a successful war against iraq will require a us occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and encourage the worst rather than best impulses of the arab world and strengthen the recruitment arm of alqaeda i am not opposed to all wars im opposed to dumb wars so for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children let us send a clear message to the president you want a fight president bush lets finish the fight with bin laden and alqaeda through effective coordinated intelligence and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism and a homeland security program that involves more than colorcoded warnings you want a fight president bush lets fight to make sure thatwe vigorously enforce a nonproliferation treaty and that former enemies and current allies like russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material and that nations like pakistan and india never use the terrible weapons already in their possession and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe you want a fight president bush lets fight to make sure our socalled allies in the middle east the saudis and the egyptians stop oppressing their own people and suppressing dissent and tolerating corruption and inequality and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education without prospects without hope the ready recruits of terrorist cells you want a fight president bush lets fight to wean ourselves off middle east oil through an energy policy that doesnt simply serve the interests of exxon and mobil those are the battles that we need to fight those are the battles that we willingly join the battles against ignorance and intolerance corruption and greed poverty and despair the consequences of war are dire the sacrifices immeasurable we may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom and pay the wages of war but we ought not we will not travel down that hellish path blindly nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood to make such an awful sacrifice in vain okay so this is not obama with a soul who paid pennies and dimes for the peace treaty when all he wanted was angela merkel to kiss him simultaneously he was upset his daughters were wearing ripped jeans and did they really have to have skin showing and of course obama has an intense stare
20 as i stood there holding angela merkels hand i saw her looking at my longingly unfortunately she fell down afterwards
50 i looked to you as it fell and now you are in my way i would trade my soul for a wish pennies and dimes for a kiss i was not looking for this but now you are in my way your stare was holding ripped jeans skin was showing
